class MessageDeleted(EventBuilder, _custom.chatgetter.ChatGetter):
    """
    Occurs whenever a message is deleted. Note that this event isn't 100%
    reliable, since Telegram doesn't always notify the clients that a message
    was deleted.

    .. important::

        Telegram **does not** send information about *where* a message
        was deleted if it occurs in private conversations with other users
        or in small group chats, because message IDs are *unique* and you
        can identify the chat with the message ID alone if you saved it
        previously.

        Telethon **does not** save information of where messages occur,
        so it cannot know in which chat a message was deleted (this will
        only work in channels, where the channel ID *is* present).

        This means that the ``chats=`` parameter will not work reliably,
        unless you intend on working with channels and super-groups only.

    Example
        .. code-block:: python

            from telethon import events

            @client.on(events.MessageDeleted)
            async def handler(event):
                # Log all deleted message IDs
                for msg_id in event.deleted_ids:
                    print('Message', msg_id, 'was deleted in', event.chat_id)
